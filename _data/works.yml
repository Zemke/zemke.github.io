  Crespo’s Worms Tournament (CWT) is a yearly hosted tournament of the strategy game “Worms Armageddon”.
  It’s considered the most prestigious of its kind and has money prizes involved.
</p>
<p>
  This is the undertaking that got me started in programming in 2009. The tournament had been held annually since 2002
  and the webmaster updated scores, tables, profiles etc. manually. One day in 2009 I challenged the situation to improve.<br>
  Ever since, the event is held using a fully autonomous tournament system with lots of extra features making the
  experience of the tournament much richer.
</p>
<p>
  There’s an implementation of the Twitch API, games can be commented and rated, there’s a chat with private message
  functionality an archive of all games and much more to engage the users.
</p>
<p>
  Through the years I rewrote the application a couple of times matching the re-implementation with my improved skill-level.
  I’ve gone from using Sublime Text and plain PHP, over CakePHP, several design iterations and am currently working
  on a rewrite in Kotlin, Spring Boot and Angular 2+ adding lots of flexibility to the system.

  Below is an illustration of how the website has evolved through the years visually. From old to new.
  The first one being the website before I took over the last a peek at the currently under development rewrite.

<p>Also I am happy it has assisted a few hundreds of unknown people, too.</p>

  Betting game that I wrote primarily in Kotlin and with Ember. It’s data-based by Postgres and the UI—for the sake of change—is
  written with the Bulma CSS framework.
</p>
<p>
  It supports multiple communities simultaneously. I hosted one for my colleagues at work and one for the family.
  <a href="https://www.football-data.org/" target="_blank">football-data.org</a> provides an API of data—kudos to Daniel.
</p>
<p>
  A previous version was built using PHP Laravel. So, this is basically one more endavor for myself to try things.

  First off, yes, it’s the site you’re on right now. How do you like it?
</p>
<p>
  When I started my self-employment I thought an own page would make sense so I can introduce myself to potential customers
  away from the sparse capabilities on agency platforms.<br>
  Also this hosts my Blog that I had before. For the future I want Zemke.IO to not only be this personal page but also
  a collection of lots of projects I work on.
</p>
<p>
  The theme is entirely written by me. I did not even reach out for a CSS framework. This makes the page quite performant
  and lightweight.<br>
  It takes advantage of the static site generator called Jekyll which is great because I’m a fan of Markdown.
