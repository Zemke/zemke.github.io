title:      Entropy Is Always Happening
summary:    Entropy makes things go from order to disorder. And it's a process that happens slowly by steadily inevitably all the time to all the things.

> That's also the reason why we're all gonna die.

The most everyday occurrence of entropy I can think of is a cup of coffee getting cold.

That's ruled over by the second law of thermodynamics which states that:

> It is impossible to construct a device that produces no other effect than transfer of heat from lower temperature body to higher temperature body.

In a world of entropy and waiting long enough everything has got to be the same temperature at one point. Therefore the hot cup of coffee is going to have the same temperature as the room it is in and that room is going to have the same temperature as all the other rooms in the house and the house is going to have the temperature of outside the house and eventually you're going to see the heat death of the universe.

Well, you're not going to see it because you'll also have the same temperature as everything else and that's unlikely to be exactly the temperature of a human body as it requires it to live on. \
Not to mention that no vital life processes can happen in your body anymore as with everything in disorder there's more processes left to create even more disorder.

To be exact, order is required for things to happen. Things happen because the ever prevalent entropy makes things happen by turning order to disorder.

## Philosophy Excursion

- If intelligence is order, decay of intelligence is always happening and has to be actively prevented.
- In a politically stable system, unrest is always going to happen and has to be actively prevented.

Is intelligence the disorder or dumbness? Perceiving intelligence as the ordering of information, I'd argue intelligence is the order.

> “The ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving: to deploy energy and information to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order.” —Steven Pinker

In a way unrest is always a sign of something being in order.

Only at **equilibrium** nothing is happening.

## In Thermodynamic Terms

Entropy is chaos, randomness, disorder. Entropy is always constant or increasing in a closed system.

> Entropy can decrease by adding from outside the system.

**First Law:** \
The increase in the internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the amount of heat energy added to the system minus the work done by the system on the surroundings.

**Second Law:** \
It is impossible to construct a device that produces no other effect than transfer of heat from lower temperature body to higher temperature body.

**Third Law:** \
The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero.

## Disorder is More Likely

Entropy really is a probability calculation.

Why is entropy always happening? It's not like there's a preference for disorder. It's just that given all the combinations it's extremely unlikely that the combination is an ordered one.

Let's assume your desk is very tidy. If you put all the things from your desk into a bucket and threw the contents of the bucket onto your desk it's highly unlikely they fall in place in the very ordered way they were before. No -- they're going to be cluttered all over the place.

## What About The Cup of Coffee?

It's become cold by now and you know why.<sub>Entropy</sub>

### But why?

Glad you're asking.

#### Newton's Law of Cooling

Rate of cooling -- I love differentiation calculus.

`T` temperature of the object
`T_a` ambient temperature
`t` time
`m` moderator (surface area and other factors)


```
T(t) = A+(T_0-A)e^(-kt)
```
